<h3>Description</h3>
</strong></p>Recognizing emotional states from the brain signals is one of the most significant advantages of electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis using deep learning methods. A major challenge in EEG-based emotion recognition is EEG analysis is time-consuming, complex and difficult.The method we discuss in this work would be EEG analysis without feature extraction and without the use of the sliding window. In this work, we seek to use one-dimension Neural Networks to classify emotions using EEG signals from the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP)<a href="https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/"_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">. We have used DEAP dataset on which we are classifying the emotion as valance, like, arousal, dominance.
